Happy to report that since I have had a word with myself my productivity has increased.

I've mentioned before now that PHP and Laravel are both in demand in my region, I have now committed to focusing on both for a little while, I think if I can add these to my tool belt I will be in a position to be employed as a software engineer ðŸ˜„

First step was to get to grips with installing Laravel and the LAMP stack on my system, you can find more details on how I did that [here](https://github.com/shan5742/log/blob/master/laravel.md) in my **GitHub log**

Once installed I decided to start with the obligatory *Hello World* Laravel style, which you can find [here](https://github.com/shan5742/laravel-hello-world), I added a little twist, as I was pushed into this from a friend and mentor.

That's it, a quick on here just to add accountability and update some links. Hopefully will be back soon with more news on Laravel and a little more complex project, but I am loving it so far!!!
