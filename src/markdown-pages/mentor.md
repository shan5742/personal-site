Any reader of this blog will have noticed me banging on about mentors a lot. I have been lucky enough to have a number of great mentors over the last few years and I attribute a lot of my career success to them, I have learnt and continue to learn so much from them. I have always wanted to give back in a similar way, but never really had the confidence to do so - until now.

### Shifting Thoughts

Initially my thoughts on mentors were that they needed to be elite in their field, but after giving it more thought that is simply false and almost inefficient. Let's say someone who has zero experience in the dev world. They will absolutely learn a lot from some rockstar dev, but a lot of that dev's talent, skills and experience will not be able to be learned from someone so new, it just wouldn't be the right time.

### What's my point?

In my opinion a great mentor just has to be one level up from their mentee. Someone in the industry for decades would struggle in terms of giving advice about getting their first job, as the reality is they're just too far away from that, they haven't interviewed with no experience for a long time.

A better fit would be someone who has recently got their first job, has recent experience going through the application and interview process etc.

This frees up the rockstar dev to work with someone mid-level wanting to take their career to the next level. To that end, I decided it was time for me to get my mentor hat on.

### Where I can fit in

So I think given that I went from zero programming knowledge to hired fairly recently I think I am in a great position to help people looking to get into the industry. I can help with what to learn, networking and general career advice in terms of getting a foot in the door.

I have been helping a few friends in recent months, one of which is now applying for jobs, which feels great - for both of us. I have loved the experience and learnt so much myself, so I figured now was the right time to cast my net further.

### Coding Coach

I applied to be a mentor on the [coding coach](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/) platform, which is where I found two of my current mentors. I am happy to say they accepted my application and I am now open for business! If you would like to work with me then you can find me [here](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Asam+Shan).

I will endeavour to help anyone who reaches out, initially I will just see how it goes and there may come a point when I take a more active role in terms of finding mentees but for now I just want to see what comes from being on the platform.
