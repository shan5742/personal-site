I was browsing [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) the other day, which is a fantastic subreddit btw when I stumbled across a great link which led me to [this](https://bttrdvlpr.com/start/) article. You sshould definitely go and read it and then join the Discord group like I did. It has turned out to be a great community led by a passionate guy who genuinely wants to help people. Yes, that is another fantastic person who spends a lot of his own time helping others.... I have said numerous times, but I will say it again, the developer community really blows my mind when it comes to people helpoing each other learn. Anyway, I ended up sending a few private messages back and forth with the site owner and he has suggested a couple of things to me that I thought I would share here. First off is record keeping, which is super important for accountability and some of the reason I started this blog. However a blog has a lot of fluff that comes with it, so he had a better idea.

## GitHub Repo as a log 

Cory suggested I start a new GitHub repo to log progress for a few reasons. Firstly it forces me to use Git almost daily, which is great practice and even better for that Green heatmap :). It will also act as a no nonsense guide to my progress for future employers who don't have the time to sift through my blog, so I am about to create that repo now and will keep a log of everything I learn in there. Hopefully will be commiting at least five times per week.

## Practice Makes Perfect

I told Cory one of my main concerns was feeling a little weak with JavaScript. Regular readers will know that I want a solid base in terms of vanilla JS and he suggested (as others have previously) that I practice everyday in the form of challenges. I have use Codewars sporadically in the past, but never really got along with it. Cory suggested [Edabit](https://edabit.com) so I have created an account and plan to practice JavaScript over there daily.

## Back to Work

Hopefully this will add another level of accountability to my learning and there is no time like the present, so I am off to do a few challenges and create a learning repo now.
