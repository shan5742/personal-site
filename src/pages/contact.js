        For better or worse I have spent a lot of time on the internet over the
        years. Mainly due to my time in online poker, if you want to here a
        little more about that then head over to my{" "}
        <StyledLink to="about">About</StyledLink> page. Anyway, over the years I
        have built a lot of great relationships online. So, yeah, in other
        words, I love meeting new people, online or in the flesh, so if you
        would like to get in touch then just email me{" "}
        <StyledA href="mailto:asamshan456@gmail.com">HERE.</StyledA>
      </p>

        Seriously though, just hit the button and contact me. Be it about
        coding, anything you have read on the blog or anything else. I would be
        happy to shoot the{" "}
