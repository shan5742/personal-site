      <p>
        Seems all the cool kids have a uses page these days, so I figured I
        would join the club, I'll hopefully get to add to this list on a regular
        basis as I aquire more bits and pieces :)

      <h3>üè¢ Work</h3>
      <p>
        At work we have some pretty solid desks, some sweet chairs, that are a
        little too hot in the summer and 2x 28" Samsung monitors sat beside teh
        MacBook Pro
      </p>
      <p>
        My boss was kind enough to provide me with a Griffin laptop stand, a
        magic mouse and apple keyboard, but hopefully I can upgrade to a
        mechanical keyboard at some point to see what all the fuss is about.
      </p>
      <h3>üè† Home Office</h3>
      <p>
        For now my home office is the kitchen table ü§£, but this is about to
        change, a dedicated home office is in the works and I have my eye on
        many a gadget to pimp it out. Remote working is somethign I fully
        support, so I intend to do a good job of the home office.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will likely conists of a standing desk, some art work, desk fan,
        plant and a whatever else takes my fancy, hopefully next time you visit
        I will have some pics.
